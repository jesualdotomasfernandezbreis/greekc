# Evaluation of the models 


This component of the evaluation aimed to study whether those templates are really applicable to data annotation. For this purpose, we applied the GO-CAMs developed to annotate the gene regulation scenarios described by selected research articles. 
Four domain experts evaluated the suitability of the GO-CAMs for representing the data presented in the articles. One expert analyzed all the articles, evaluated the applicability of the GO-CAMs developed and assigned each article to one or more GO-CAMs, depending on the content of the article. Each research article was then analyzed by another domain expert. 

Hence, three experts were asked to provide one of the following answers for the articles:
1. The GO-CAM associated is not useful for this article.
2. The article does not provide all the data required by the GO-CAM.
3. The GO-CAM permits to capture all the data of the article.
4. The article has relevant data which is not represented in the GO-CAM.

The experts could also add additional information in free text. The results were analyzed by GO-CAM template and globally, that is, all together.
