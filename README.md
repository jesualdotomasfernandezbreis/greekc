# Formalization of gene regulation knowledge using ontologies and Gene Ontology Causal Activity Models

## Description of the repository
This repository contains the data of the paper entitled "Formalization of gene regulation knowledge using ontologies and Gene Ontology Causal Activity Models", submitted to the journal **Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Gene Regulatory Mechanisms**, which describes a research activity carried out by the Working Group 1 of the [GREEKC Consortium](https://www.greekc.org). 

## Abstract
Gene regulation computational research requires handling and integrating large amounts of heterogeneous data. The Gene Ontology has demonstrated that ontologies play a fundamental role in biological data interoperability and integration. Ontologies help to express data and knowledge in a machine processable way, which enables complex querying and advanced exploitation of distributed data. Contributing to improve data interoperability in gene regulation is a major objective of the GREEKC Consortium, which aims to develop a standardized gene regulation knowledge commons. GREEKC proposes the use of ontologies and semantic tools for developing interoperable gene regulation knowledge models, which should support data annotation. In this work, we study how such knowledge models can be generated from graphical representations of gene reg- ulation scenarios. The proposed method consists of generating descriptions in natural language of the graphical representations; extracting the entities from the texts; finding those entities in existing ontologies to reuse as much content as possible, especially from well known and maintained ontologies such as the Gene Ontology, the Sequence Ontology, the Relations Ontology and ChEBI; and implementation of the knowledge models. The models have been implemented using Prot ́eg ́e, a general ontology editor, and Noctua, the tool developed by the Gene Ontology Consortium for the development of causal activity models to capture more comprehensive annotations of genes and link their activities in a causal framework for Gene Ontology Annotations. We applied the method to two gene regulation scenarios and illustrate how the models generated can be applied to annotate data from research articles.


## Use cases

* [Use case 1: Transcription regulation of a promoter](https://github.com/jesualdotomasfernandezbreis/greekc/tree/main/usecase1/readme.md)


* [Use case 2: Gene regulation by regulators on an enhancer that loops to a promoter](https://github.com/jesualdotomasfernandezbreis/greekc/tree/main/usecase2/readme.md)

## Evaluation
